## Introduction

Is is known that a wallet address is a lifeless sequence of characters that functions as a unique identifier for a user within blockchain networks. The profiler application is designed to present comprehensive information that delineates the user's personality, traits, and profile.

This project aims to:
- Automatically categorize wallet addresses based on the associated project and the type of project in which they are involved. Furthermore, distinctive wallets, such as those belonging to foundations (projects, exchanges, teams, etc.), should also be appropriately labeled. 
- Identify associated wallets or those that impact a wallet address, including highly interactive wallets, whale wallets, and others.
- Link relevant social media accounts.
